# Dynamic-Homepage-Template

A modern, responsive homepage template built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a starting point for a personal or product landing page, featuring custom front-end logic likely for interactivity or a theme/state change (indicated by the included image assets).

## üöÄ Features

* **Responsive Layout:** Styled using `home.css` for optimal viewing across various devices.
* **Custom Interactivity:** Logic in `home.js` handles dynamic elements, event listeners, and animations.
* **State/Theme Switching:** Includes two different image assets (`black.png` and `red.png`), suggesting a theme toggle, dark/light mode, or a hover/click state change for a key visual element.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

The project follows a standard file structure for a simple website.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `home.html` | The main HTML document, containing the page structure, content, and links to the CSS and JavaScript files. |
| `home.css` | The stylesheet that defines the website's design, layout, and visual appearance. |
| `home.js` | The JavaScript file that adds interactive features, animations, and custom front-end logic. |
| `black.png` | An image asset, likely the default or one of the visual states (e.g., 'dark' or 'inactive'). |
| `red.png` | An image asset, likely representing an alternate visual state (e.g., 'light' or 'active'). |
